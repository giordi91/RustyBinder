# RustyBinder
![alt text](docs/images/logo.jpg "logo")

A native rust port of
[The binder](https://github.com/giordi91/TheBinder).


This is a scripting language written mostly as a learning project following https://craftinginterpreters.com/ book. Hopefully at one point I would like to use it in my game engine to **bind** the gameplay and backend.

## Goals
The main goal of this project is to learn more of rust and actually get into the flow more. 
I tried to jump into graphics immediately, altough I got stuff working I found it quite slow and potentially too ambituous as a goal. Meanwhile I keep working on the graphics side of things I wanted 
a more stand alone and contained project to work on. 

I decided to rework from scratch and clean slate the binder language. Not only that but to keep the wasm generation path, which worked quite well with emscripten. I expect it to work even better with the Rust tooling!
